**Project Planning**
Monday:
1. Dataset Chosen from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
2. Description of the Dataset: The Telco dataset tracks customer behaviour and attributes to understand why customers leave a telecommunications company(churn).
The dataset is designed for general churn analysis, there are no explicit years included.
3. Defining questions to be explored through the dataset:
  - Which customer segments are high risk in terms of churn?
  - How do customer tenure and contract length interact to influence churn?
  - How do service bundles (e.g., phone + internet) impact churn?
  - Does TechSupport usage reduce churn for high-risk customers?
  - What is the average monthly and yearly revenue lost due to churn?
  - What would be the impact of targeted retention strategies in terms of revenue?
  - How does customer lifetime value differ between churner and non-churner customers?
