**Project Planning**
Monday:
1. Dataset Chosen from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
2. Link to Tableau Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/views/Telco_customer_churn/Story1?:language=de-DE&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
3. Description of the Dataset: The Telco dataset tracks customer behaviour and attributes to understand why customers leave a telecommunications company(churn).
The dataset is designed for general churn analysis, there are no explicit years included.
4. Defining questions to be explored through the dataset:
-Defining high-risk customer segments in terms of churn 
-Which customer attributes or services are more prone to churn?
-How does customer lifetime value differ between churner and non-churner customers?
-How much revenue is lost due to churn in high-risk segments?
