#**Project Planning**
#Monday:
##1. Dataset Chosen from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
-Description of the Dataset: The Telco dataset tracks customer behaviour and attributes to understand why customers leave a telecommunications company(churn).
The dataset is designed for general churn analysis, there are no explicit years included.
##2. Defining questions to be explored through the dataset:
###2.1.How do customer tenure and contract length interact to influence churn?
###2.2. How do service bundles (e.g., phone + internet) impact churn?
###2.3. Does TechSupport usage reduce churn for high-risk customers?
###2.4. What would be the impact of targeted retention strategies in terms of revenue?
###2.5. How does customer lifetime value differ between churner and non-churner customers?
#Tuesday:
##3. Data Cleaning
###3.1. Checking if all data types are correctly assigned. If not modify them correctly.
###3.2. Remove missing and duplicate values.
##4. Starting with the Exploratory Data Analysis
###4.1. Creating the variables(e.g. interaction variables etc.)
###4.2. Performing statistical analysis to determine relationships
#Wednesday
##5. Based on the results of your EDA, define actionable strategies in relation to your initial questions.
###E.g. If bundles reduce churn, promote them etc.
##6. Start with data visualization using Tableau, build a compelling narrative
#Thursday
##7. Finalize your dashboard, apply storytelling
